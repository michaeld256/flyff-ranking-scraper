# flyff-ranking-scraper
A simple web scraper for the [Official Flyff Universe Ranking](https://universe.flyff.com/sniegu/ranking/characters), which is used in a very similiar way in my project [SiegeStats](https://siegestats.cc) to get extra player data. This webscraper is based upon Puppeteer, which may be overkill. I may replace the usage of Puppeteer with simple HTTP-WebRequests later on.

## Context
[Flyff Universe](https://universe.flyff.com/) is a MMORPG from 2004 with a fairly active community for its age. It provides a public ranking website, ranking the different ingame characters by their level and providing further data about the characters, such as name, sex, job/class, job-/classrank, guild and the overall playtime.
